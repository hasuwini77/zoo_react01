a home page
a page detailing the mammal
a page details the birds
a page detailing the reptiles

- Each page should have a header with a logo

- Each page should have a navigational menu with links to “home”, "birds", "mammals" and "reptiles".

Each page should have a footer with some content.

Each page should have a side bar and a main content area – the content of both of these areas will be different for each page, but the page layouts should be similar
